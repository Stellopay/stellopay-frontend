## Error States vs Empty States

The Transactions list component distinguishes between an empty result (e.g. no transactions matching the selected filters) and a network or server error.

- **Empty State**: Rendered via the `TransactionsTable` empty message (`No transactions found. Try adjusting your filters.`).
- **Error State**: Rendered using the `<ErrorState />` UI component which displays the actual error message or a generic "Failed to load transactions." It also provides a "Try Again" button.

### Accessibility Notes (WCAG 2.1 AA)

- **Contrast**: The ErrorState uses a `text-red-500` icon and `text-white` text on a `bg-red-900/10` background which exceeds minimum contrast requirements.
- **Keyboard Nav**: The "Try Again" button is fully keyboard navigable. Focus order is maintained.
- **ARIA**: The `ErrorState` component utilizes `role="alert"` and `aria-live="assertive"` so screen readers can proactively announce network failures. Loading/Retrying indicators use `aria-hidden="true"` on non-text elements and `aria-label` or `aria-disabled` where appropriate to ensure status is accurately conveyed.
