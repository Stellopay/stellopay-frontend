## Package manager

This repo uses **npm** exclusively. `package-lock.json` is the single source of truth for dependency resolution, and CI installs with `npm ci`.

- Install dependencies: `npm install`
- Reproducible install (CI / clean clone): `npm ci`
- Do not use `yarn` or `pnpm` to install or add dependencies — they generate `yarn.lock` / `pnpm-lock.yaml`, which drift from `package-lock.json` and risk inconsistent dependency versions between contributors and CI.
- A `preinstall` check (`scripts/check-package-manager.js`) fails the install if a `yarn.lock` or `pnpm-lock.yaml` file is present in the repo root. If you see that error, delete the stray lockfile and re-run `npm install`.

If you need to add or update a dependency, run `npm install <package>` (or `npm update`) and commit the resulting changes to `package.json` and `package-lock.json` together.
